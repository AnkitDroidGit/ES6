# Understding ES6 with examples

## What is ECMAScript6?

ECMA stand for European Computer Manufacturer Association. ECMA is the association that puts out the guidelines for JavaScript in all browsers.

It means that we now have a ton of new options to work with when designing our JavaScript projects. We have new keywords available for declaring variables, like let and const. For functions, we can also use default parameters and arrow functions. ES 6 also contains classes, template strings, and new ways for dealing with arrays and objects.

- [Using `const` keyword](./using-const-keyword/index.html) - `const` is a great tool to use when we're dealing with constant values.
